# Chess

This is an implementation of Chess and Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) built using Java, JUnit, Swing, and JavaFX.

The photo below shows an example configuration of the game on a classic olive and beige checkerboard background, where each unit is represented by a letter, such as P for pawn or Q for queen.
